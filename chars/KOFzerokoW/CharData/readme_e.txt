zeroko(White)

The concept of this production is mainly about "the character looks like a TYPEMOON, but actually it's not"

Well, half of the reason why I made this character is for Miss.SHIKI, so all the setting and background 
story is in a way connected.

By the way, these two characters are not homosexual.

At least Miss.SHIKI thinks herself is heterosexual. but ZEROKO's first love was Mr.BIG.

The relationship between ZEROKO and MrBIG is similar to B.Jenet and Terry.
