This AI is for Atena Heidern made by Mr. S.Y.D .

[How to use]
You can adjust AI level.
This AI has 10+1 levels.
1~10 AI made by UMA   easy1---->5---->10hard
-1      AI made by Mr.S.Y.D

[How to adjust AI level]
First at all, edit AI.txt with editer like notepad , wordpad ,emacs, or so on.
And serch the words like under this sentense

[State -3, AIフラグセット]
type = VarSet
triggerall = !var(59)
triggerall = RoundState = [1,2]
trigger1 = Command = "cpu"|| Command = "cpu2"|| Command = "cpu3"|| Command = "cpu4"|| Command = "cpu50"
trigger2 = Command = "cpu5"|| Command = "cpu6"|| Command = "cpu7"|| Command = "cpu8"|| Command = "cpu9"
・
・
trigger10 = Command = "cpu45"|| Command = "cpu46"|| Command = "cpu47"|| Command = "cpu48"|| Command = "cpu49"
trigger11 = numhelper(10000)>0
Trigger11 = Helper(10000),var(59)
trigger11 = roundno != 1 || power < powermax || enemynear,power < enemynear,powermax || life < lifemax || enemynear,life < enemynear,lifemax
var(59) = 10 ;  ←AI Level. 

So, this  number ,default is 10, is the Level.
You may change this number from1 to 10 or -1.
0 is no AI. 

[SuperCancel & DreamCancel]
I put states to adjust power loss under the AI switch state.
You can adjust power loss at SuperCancel and DreamCancel.
And I put "how to adjust" in there, so please refer it.
