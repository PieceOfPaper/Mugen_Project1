This character used a lot of 'Heidern' code from 'tatsu'
actually I was about to release it after I get warrant from 'tatsu', but it was impossible
to get his E-mail address. So I want to say sorry to everyone.
I tried the E-mail address at his active homepage, but there was no reply.
If anyone looking at this knows tatsu's actual E-mail, please send e-mail to the '00245syd@naver.com'.

I also used code from 'David Demianoff(ironmugen)'. 
It could've been worse than that run something by him.
I can't thanks enough!! (Thank you very much, David Demianoff.)

I also used code from 'Fervicante'. 
This person also hard to find e-mail so I failed.
Again, if anyone knows about these 2 people's e-mail, please send me an e-mail to '00245syd@naver.com'.

Even though there are not enough things on character, thanks for playing.
